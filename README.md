An automated Python application that sends personalized birthday emails by reading stored contact data 
and dynamically generating customized messages using predefined templates.
This project demonstrates automation, file handling, data processing, and email integration using Python.

# Overview
The Birthday Wisher project automatically:
- Reads birthday data from a CSV file
- Checks if today matches any stored birthdays
- Randomly selects a birthday message template
- Personalizes the message
- Sends an email using Gmail’s SMTP server via python anywhere.
The program can be scheduled to run daily, making it a fully automated birthday reminder and email system.
